# PWA Text Editor #

**Note:** This repository contains the source code for module 19 homework of GA Tech's 2022 Coding Bootcamp.

## Description ##

The goal of this assignment is to create a text editor that runs in your browser.  It will also have additional features, one ofwhich being able to function while offline.  I have not finished the projecyt completely, but have made progress.  I have installed all of the necessary npm packages, and worked on the logic in the src folder, as well as the src-sw.js and webpack-config files.  I plan to go back and finish the rest when i have the chance.
