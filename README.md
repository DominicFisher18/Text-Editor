# PWA Text Editor #

**Note:** This repository contains the source code for module 19 homework of GA Tech's 2022 Coding Bootcamp.

## Description ##

The goal of this assignment is to create a text editor that runs in your browser.  It will also have additional features, one ofwhich being able to function while offline.  I have not finished the project completely, but have made progress.  So far I have installed all of the necessary npm packages, uncovered the dist folder, added the required event listeners and handlers, implemented asset caching, and added css loaders/babel to the webpack.  I still need to work on the logic in the database.js folder, as well as getting the application to open on the browser properly.
